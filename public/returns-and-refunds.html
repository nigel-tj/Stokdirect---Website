      <p class="mt-5">Perishable goods are products that have a shorter shelf life and may deteriorate
          quickly due to environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity). Examples include fresh produce, baked goods,
          cooked food, live products, chilled and frozen products, etc.</p>
  
      <p class="mt-5"><span class="c3">Please log a call with our Support for assistance with your order number and product id

          products delivered i.e expired, short delivered, etc shall only be made to your PricepStokdirect wallet or
          Stokcoin. </span></p>
      
      <p class="mt-5"><strong>Please note that Stokdirect Virtual Wholesale shall determine returns/refunds on a

      <p class="mt-5"><span class="c3">If you haven&rsquo;t received a refund yet, first check your Stokdirect wallet or bank
          account again. Contact your credit card company or bank as it may take some time before your refund reflects. Next
          contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund reflects.</span></p>
