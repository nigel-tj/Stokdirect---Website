      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Getting Started as a Driver</strong></h3>
      <p>Go to <a href="//erp.stokdirect.africa/register/new">www.stokdirect.africa</a> </p>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Register for an account and complete your driver profile.</li>
        <li>Complete all required driver, vehicle and banking information.</li>
        <li>Upload required driver, vehicle documentation and all other documents needed.</li>
        <li>Once the profile has been completed, with all required documents, you will receive communication via email or sms, informing of your induction date and vehicle inspection at a given location.</li>
        <li>An “active driver” on Stokdirect, receives orders via our driver app with all customer delivery information.</li>
        <li>Routes can be optimised for best results.</li>
        <li>Upon delivery, the customer will give you a rating.</li>
        <li>All successful orders get paid out at the end of every week.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>These are the steps for every driver-partner who has passed our vetting and training program.</strong></h3>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Log into your driver profile on the Stokdirect driver app (Only driver partners that have logged into their app will show active status and be able to receive order deliveries)</li>
        <li>You are able to set your coverage based on the area which you wish to work or you can be available to deliver nationally</li>
        <li>Upon receipt of an order, you can optimize for best route or simply follow given route to customer destination</li>
        <li>With the driver app, you can communicate directly with Stokdirect Support team for any enquiries you may have or assistance you need</li>
        <li>Upon arrival, your customer may already be waiting for you as they are able to see the progress of your delivery. Please request they show you on their phone their customer app showing your arrival to ensure you are delivering to the correct customer.</li>
        <li>Once products have been offloaded, take picture of the destination address, customer identity (ID, drivers license, passport) and request for customer signature</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <strong>N.B: It is highly important that all POD's are signed before you leave the destination address and have completed the order, otherwise it will not count on your delivery history, which means not getting remunerated for the delivery.</strong>
