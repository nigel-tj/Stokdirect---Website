      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Delivering Goods to Customers: How We Get It Right Every Time</strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Stokdirect is able to offer efficient last mile distribution through an independent owner-driver and organised fleet network that is linked to our Forward Stock Locations (FSL). Our buyers are further able to keep track of every step in real time of their deliveries.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Hiring and training delivery drivers</strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Our driver partners are critical to our success and without quality delivery drivers who reflect the values of our business, we run the risk of unhappy customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">We understand that getting packages in good condition is very important to our customers. So it is important that our driver partners are properly trained to act and think like a professional delivery service.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Create and optimize delivery routes</strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">Route optimization is key in being able to ensure efficiency and happy customers. With our integrated driver software, our driver-partners are able to view customer information pertaining to their delivery routes. We can also make changes and customize routes needed whilst the driver is on the road.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Giving our driver-partners the tools they need to succeed</strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        It is highly important to Stokdirect that we equip our driver-partners with the right tools to service our customers and succeed in growing their own business. We do this by simplifying their job, and letting them focus on making their deliveries quickly, professionally, and in a customer-friendly manner.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Our driver-partner training includes vehicle vetting, customer service training and the driver app will give these partners the right tools to succeed. We also have driver incentives in place to ensure reward is given for achievements making the relationship between Stokdirect and our driver partners fun, easy and makes them money and Growth.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Factors Stokdirect has considered in acquiring driver partners:</strong></h3>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>The type of vehicle needed to be able to do deliveries</li>
        <li>Devices (hardware) needed to execute deliveries</li>
        <li>Software and apps needed to execute successful deliveries efficiently</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>Getting Started as a Driver</strong></h3>
      <a class="py-2 px-4 rounded-md bg-[#E2BF17]" href="//erp.stokdirect.africa/register/new">Signup as a Driver Partner</a> 
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mt-5">
        <li>Register for an account and complete your driver profile.</li>
        <li>Complete all required driver, vehicle and banking information.</li>
        <li>Upload required driver, vehicle documentation and all other documents needed.</li>
        <li>Once the profile has been completed, with all required documents, you will receive communication via email or sms, informing of your induction date and vehicle inspection at a given location.</li>
        <li>An “active driver” on Stokdirect, receives orders via our driver app with all customer delivery information.</li>
        <li>Routes can be optimised for best results.</li>
        <li>Upon delivery, the customer will give you a rating.</li>
        <li>All successful orders get paid out at the end of every week.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>These are the steps for every driver-partner who has passed our vetting and training program.</strong></h3>
      <ul class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Log into your driver profile on the Stokdirect driver app (Only driver partners that have logged into their app will show active status and be able to receive order deliveries)</li>
        <li>You are able to set your coverage based on the area which you wish to work or you can be available to deliver nationally</li>
        <li>Upon receipt of an order, you can optimize for best route or simply follow given route to customer destination</li>
        <li>With the driver app, you can communicate directly with Stokdirect Support team for any enquiries you may have or assistance you need</li>
        <li>Upon arrival, your customer may already be waiting for you as they are able to see the progress of your delivery. Please request they show you on their phone their customer app showing your arrival to ensure you are delivering to the correct customer.</li>
        <li>Once products have been offloaded, take picture of the destination address, customer identity (ID, drivers license, passport) and request for customer signature</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <strong>N.B: It is highly important that all POD's are signed before you leave the destination address and have completed the order, otherwise it will not count on your delivery history, which means not getting remunerated for the delivery.</strong>
