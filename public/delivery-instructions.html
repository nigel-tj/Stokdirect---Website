        Stokdirect is able to offer efficient last mile distribution through an independent owner-driver and organised fleet network that is linked to our Forward Stock Locations (FSL). Our buyers are further able to keep track of every step in real time of their deliveries.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        As Stokdirect we have realised that local businesses have a massive opportunity to increase their sales by offering local delivery directly to their customers. Moreso during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns, when they had to offer direct-to-consumer delivery to simply stay afloat. Even as the lockdowns loosened, many of these businesses chose to keep offering local delivery. Their new service had been a hit amongst new customers and loyal customers, however this also increased costs.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        When we offer delivery services to our customers we take note of unnecessary costs, risks, and challenges that our delivery partners may encounter and mitigate it with a good delivery startegy. 
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        We also looked at ways that make a great delivery experience and maintain even greater customer service. 
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        We looked at the following factors when looking at delivering goods to our customers:   
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
        <li>Hiring and training delivery drivers</li>
        <li>Creating and optimizing delivery routes</li>
        <li>Monitoring routes and providing real-time delivery updates</li>
        <li>Collecting proof of delivery</li>
        <li>Giving our driver partners the tools they need to succeed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong><span class="mt-5">Hiring and training delivery drivers</span></strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        Our driver partners are critical to our success and without quality delivery drivers who reflect the values of our business, we run the risk of late deliveries and damaged goods. We understand that getting customer packages in good condition is very important to our customers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-5">
        We understand that in the world of delivery, even the smallest mistakes can be costly as our driver partners are often making dozens of stops a day. So it is important that our driver partners are properly trained to act and think like a professional delivery service. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong><span class="mt-5">Create and optimize delivery routes</span></strong></h3>
      <p class="mt-5">
        The cornerstone of a successful delivery business is the route. Without a route optimized for speed and efficiency, two things will occur:
      </p>
      
    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>1. Increased Costs</strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      The longer the driver spends on the road, the higher the labor and fuel costs. Plus, the greater the wear and tear put on the partner's vehicle.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>2. Unsatisfied Customers</strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      We understand that getting customer packages in good condition is very important to our customers and a bad route plan means late deliveries and unsatisfied customers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>Route optimization</strong> is the absolute key in being able to ensure efficiency and happy customers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      With our integrated driver software, our driver partners are able to view customer information pertaining to their delivery routes. We can also make changes and customize routes needed whilst the driver is on the road. We may even set priority stops and time windows for different deliveries.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      <strong>Priority Stops</strong> are specific stops set as Top Priority. This way, our software knows to make sure our driver partner hits that stop first.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      A time window is when a delivery needs to happen within a specific timeframe. This is a major benefit for deliveries that may have set hours. This feature allows our deliveries to happen during the times a customer may have set or requested.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Once the route has been set, our software will optimize it for efficiency with the best possible route that further aligns with priority stops and within a customer set time window.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our algorithm does this by factoring in several variables, including distance, speed, and traffic patterns. On average, our route optimization software saves our driver partners time spent planning and executing their deliveries.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our route optimization software in addition to being quick is also accurate. This is of course critical for giving a great delivery experience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>3. Monitoring routes and providing real-time delivery updates</strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      We know unexpected changes happen and so do customers. What matters more is that those changes are communicated to our customers.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      With orders assigned and routes optimized to our driver partners, customers are able to monitor in real time, with driver and vehicle details the progress of their order.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      This means our route monitoring feature just doesn’t tell the location of our driver partner, but also how many deliveries they’ve completed, plus an updated ETA.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Stokdirect's Support team is also able to send out automatic delivery updates to our customers by SMS, email, or both.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our customers get an alert when our driver partner starts the route, giving them an estimated time of arrival (ETA) based on the optimized route and they are also given a link to a dashboard that’s updated throughout the day that tells them how long until their delivery arrives.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      When our driver partner gets close to completing their stop, our customer receives a final update with a new ETA. This sets the expectation and preparation of receiving the delivery.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>4. Collect proof of delivery</strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Confirming that our customer’s goods are delivered on time and at the right location, we have a number of ways that our driver partner can provide proof of delivery.  Proof of delivery (POD) gives everyone i.e drivers, support teams, and customers peace of mind about the delivery.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>a) Photographic capture </strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      This is when the driver partner will take a picture of the destination address and identification of the receiver. 
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our driver partner can snap a photo with their smartphone of where and who they left the order, and load it into their Stokdirect driver app. A copy of the POD gets sent to the customer’s email, and is also available for future reference and as proof in our cloud storage.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>b) Customer signature </strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our driver partner can collect a customer’s signature on their smartphone. The signature is stored, and a copy is sent to the customer’s email.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2"> <strong>5. Giving our driver partners the tools they need to succeed</strong></h3>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our driver partners are vital to our success, so it is of the highest importance that we equip them with the right tools to service our customers and succeed in growing their own business. We do this by simplifying their job, and letting them focus on making their deliveries quickly, professionally, and in a customer-friendly manner.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Our driver partner training that includes vehicle vetting and our driver app will give these partners the right tools to succeed. We also have driver incentives in place to ensure reward is given for achievements, that makes the relationship between Stokdirect and our driver partners fun, easy and makes them money and growth.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      Stokdirect has taken great consideration in acquiring driver partners:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-inside list-disc mt-2">
      <li>The type of vehicle needed to be able to do deliveries</li>
      <li>Devices (hardware) needed to execute deliveries</li>
      <li>Software and apps needed to execute successful deliveries efficiently</li>
    </ul>
